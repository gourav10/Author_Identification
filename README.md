### Project Description:
	Authorship identification is an essential subject matter in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It facilitates us to identify the most probable author of articles, news, or messages. Authorship identification can be applied to tasks such as identifying anonymous author, detecting plagiarism, or finding ghost writer.
	Through this project we plan to employ classification techniques to differentiate different authors using both classic machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forests and Na√Øve Bayes as well as deep learning models such as LSTM and
GRU.
		
### IDE
Jupyter Notebook

### Instructions for running the python files
	1. Make sure to install pytorch, and sk-learn on your machine
	2. Before executing the code make sure that the dataset is present the directory structure: 
		<root_dir>
		|_./dataset
			|_author_list.txt
			|_Gungor_2018_VictorianAuthorAttribution_data.csv
			|_Gungor_2018_VictorianAuthorAttribution_data-train.csv
			|_test_author.mat
	3. Open the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell.
